Higher Education Growth Model
Visit our website: www.edtraverse.com

The Higher Education Growth Model offers cutting-edge insights for stakeholders in the higher education sector. By forecasting the growth or decline of colleges based on demographics, selectivity, and the labor market's demand for academic programs, this tool helps edtech companies, insurers, lenders, and educational institutions make data-driven market decisions.

Features
Tuition Revenue Forecasting: Utilizes demographic trends, institutional selectivity, and academic program mix to project changes to net tuition and operating revenues.
For Prospective Students/Parents: Provides a web-app lookup tool to view the prospects of individual colleges. Information is directional (non-precise), but comprehensive, so you can view the overall picture.
For Organizations: Offers the full dataset for 3,000 private and public 4-year institutions and community colleges. This can be used to identify segments of growing colleges with increasing budgets to buy your products and services. Also available are more limited peer-grouping analyses.
Usage
I've open-sourced the base algorithm and the website under the MIT License. However, my data sources for student demographics and selectivity are encrypted.
